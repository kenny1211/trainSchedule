# Train Scheduler

#### Link: https://kenny1211.github.io/trainSchedule/

## Introduction

A basic application that takes in the following input:

* Train Name
* Destination
* First Train Time
* Frequency of train in minutes

The mentioned user input is then pushed to firebase for data consistency. With that data and some logic with the help of moment.js, a table is dynamically created that holds the user input along with a few new additions:

* The next train time arrival
* How many minutes there are until the above arrival time

## Still Under Construction
A few things still need to be done:

* aesthetic styling
* validation of user input
* user authentication

## Outro
I am still learning so I focused on the logic and functionality aspects primarily. As time comes, I will learn more and continue to update this application to become more well-rounded and professional. Thanks for taking a look, any constructive criticism will be well appreciated!
